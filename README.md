# Celer Routes

## Description

Celer is a routing engine used for *Breath of the Wild* and *Tears of the Kingdom* speedruns, made by [Pistonight](https://github.com/Pistonight). This repository is acting as a collection for all of the ones that I wrote for BOTW!

## Important
It is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the current WR route of the category that you are aiming to run. This ensures that you aren't going in completely blind, and know the little details seen in the route.
